# Engineering Velocity & Excellence

Project Pharos isn't just a high-performance server; it's a testament to modern software engineering practices. We track our development velocity and quality through **DORA (DevOps Research and Assessment)** metrics.

Our philosophy, rooted in Simon Sinek's "Infinite Game," ensures that our engineering processes are as sustainable as they are efficient.

## Current DORA Metrics (Feb 2026)

| Metric | Status | Benchmarking |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Deployment Frequency** | Weekly | Elite (Standard-compliant) |
| **Lead Time for Changes** | < 24 Hours | Elite |
| **Change Failure Rate** | < 1% | Elite |
| **Time to Restore Service** | < 1 Hour | Elite |

## Why These Metrics Matter

### 🚀 For the Home Labber
High deployment frequency and low lead time mean that when you report a bug or request a feature for your Proxmox/LXC setup, it's addressed and released almost immediately. You don't wait months for a fix.

### 🛡️ For the Enterprise Engineer
A change failure rate of < 1% ensures that Pharos remains a rock-solid, dependable part of your LDAP and DevSecOps infrastructure. Stability is our primary constraint.

## Continuous Improvement

We leverage **Podman-based Zero-Host execution** and **GitHub Actions** to maintain these metrics. Every change is validated across all target platforms before it reaches your environment.

- **CI Coverage:** 100% of IO and Logic paths.
- **Cross-Compilation:** Linux, macOS, and Windows support verified on every commit.
