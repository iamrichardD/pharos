While this site (`iamrichardd.com/pharos/`) provides static documentation and architectural guidance, the **Pharos Console** is the live heartbeat of your infrastructure.

## What is the Pharos Console?

The Pharos Console is a dynamic web application co-hosted with your `pharos-server` (or deployed as a standalone LXC service). It provides a real-time view of your inventory, node telemetry, and security configuration.

### Key Features
- **Pulse Monitor**: Real-time visualization of `pharos-pulse` heartbeat data across your entire fleet.
- **Key Management**: A centralized interface for enrolling and revoking SSH public keys for Write operations.
- **Provisioning**: Generate short-lived tokens for one-click node enrollment.
- **TUI/Web Hybrid**: Access the full server dashboard from any browser.

## AI Orchestration with WebMCP

Pharos is the first infrastructure tool built from the ground up for the AI-agent era. The Console implements the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** and **WebMCP** to allow LLMs to safely manage your lab.

### How WebMCP Works
WebMCP acts as a secure bridge between your browser and an AI agent (like Gemini or Claude). Instead of the agent "scraping" the DOM, the Console exposes structured JavaScript tools.

1.  **Tool Discovery**: When you ask an agent to "Add this node to my lab," the agent discovers the `add_ssh_key` or `create_provisioning_token` tools.
2.  **Human-in-the-Loop (HitL)**: For destructive actions (like `revoke_ssh_key`), the Console will trigger a browser-level confirmation modal. **The agent cannot bypass your manual approval.**
3.  **Scoped Access**: The agent only sees the tools and data you have explicitly granted access to via your current session.

### Available Tools

| Tool | Description | HitL Required |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `add_ssh_key` | Enrolls a new public key for a team. | No |
| `revoke_ssh_key` | Immediately cuts off write access for a key. | **Yes** |
| `create_provisioning_token` | Generates a single-use enrollment token. | **Yes** |
| `query_telemetry` | Retrieves the latest metrics for a node. | No |

## Deployment & Separation

To maintain high availability, we recommend keeping these two sites separate:

1.  **Documentation (This Site)**: Hosted on GitHub Pages or a CDN. Always available, even if your lab is offline.
2.  **Management (Pharos Console)**: Hosted inside your private network (e.g., in a Proxmox LXC). Provides the direct interface to your `pharos-server`.

### Running the Console
The console is included with the `pharos-server` binary or can be run via Node.js:

```bash
# Start the Pharos Server with the Console enabled
export PHAROS_CONSOLE_ENABLE=true
export PHAROS_CONSOLE_PORT=3000
./pharos-server
```

Access the dashboard at `http://<your-server-ip>:3000`.
