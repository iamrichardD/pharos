# 🌟 Community Showcase

Project Pharos is more than just a protocol; it's a foundation for building high-performance, read-optimized infrastructure. Here's how our community is making a difference.

## 🏠 The Home Lab: Automated LXC Inventory

**User:** `@homelab-hero`
**Environment:** Proxmox VE, 12 LXC Containers

### The Challenge
Managing static IP addresses and hostnames across a dozen LXC containers was becoming a manual nightmare. The user needed a single source of truth that was lightweight enough to run on a Raspberry Pi 4.

### The Pharos Solution
By deploying Pharos as a central registry, the user integrated a custom `post-provisioning` script in Proxmox.

- **Automation:** Every time a new LXC is created, a hook calls `mdb add` to register the new machine.
- **Discovery:** Other containers use `mdb query` to find the IP of the database or monitoring server.

> "Pharos turned my messy spreadsheet into a live, queryable API. It's the DNS that actually tells me what my infrastructure looks like." — `@homelab-hero`

## 🏢 Enterprise: DevSecOps "Write-Once" Infrastructure

**User:** Global Logistics Corp (Infrastructure Team)
**Environment:** Hybrid Cloud, Kubernetes, LDAP

### The Challenge
The security team required strict attribution for all infrastructure changes. They needed a way to update the global phonebook that didn't involve sharing passwords or managing complex IAM policies for simple metadata.

### The Pharos Solution
Pharos was deployed with the **Enterprise Tier** (LDAP backend) and **SSH-key authentication**.

- **Attribution:** Every update is signed by an engineer's existing SSH key. No new passwords to manage.
- **Consistency:** Pharos syncs directly to the corporate LDAP, ensuring the "People" and "Machine" directories are always in lockstep.
- **Speed:** With 90% read traffic, the sub-millisecond response time of Pharos outperformed their legacy LDAP queries for common lookups.

## 🚀 The "Badass" Use Case: Edge Node Discovery

**User:** Open-Source IoT Project
**Environment:** 500+ Edge Gateways

### The Challenge
Edge devices behind NAT needed a way to register their public-facing IP and health status to a central coordinator without the overhead of a full service mesh.

### The Pharos Solution
They used the **Pharos Middleware System** to implement a custom hook that validates edge node certificates before allowing a registration.

- **Minimal Footprint:** The `ph` CLI was cross-compiled for `aarch64` and deployed as a 2MB binary on every edge node.
- **Resilience:** The nodes heartbeat their status into Pharos, and the dashboard queries Pharos to visualize the entire network in real-time.
