Project Pharos is a highly performant, read-optimized client-server ecosystem based on RFC 2378 (Phonebook Protocol).

## System Overview

The following diagram illustrates the high-level architecture of Pharos, showing the interaction between CLI clients and the server components.

```mermaid

    subgraph Clients
        PH[ph CLI - People]
        MDB[mdb CLI - Machines]
        SCAN[pharos-scan - Discovery]
    end

## Storage Tiering Logic

Pharos uses a tiered storage approach to cater to different deployment environments, from volatile development instances to persistent enterprise-grade directory services.

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Tier 1: Development"
        Mem[MemoryStorage]
        Mem -.->|Volatile| Data((In-Memory))
    end

    subgraph "Tier 2: Home Lab"
        File[FileStorage]
        File -.->|Persistent| JSON[(Local JSON File)]
    end

    subgraph "Tier 3: Enterprise"
        LDAP[LdapStorage]
        LDAP -.->|Centralized| Directory[(LDAP Server)]
    end
```

## Core Protocol: RFC 2378 (Modified)

Pharos implements the Phonebook Protocol with extensions for modern infrastructure management and secure authentication.

### Message Flow
1. **QUERY:** Client sends a search string.
2. **DISCRIMINATE:** Server identifies if the target is a `person` or `machine`.
3. **AUTH (if Write):** Server issues an SSH challenge. Client signs and returns.
4. **RESPONSE:** Server returns records in Ph format.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Server
    participant Auth
    participant Storage

    Client->>Server: QUERY "name=John"
    Server->>Storage: Search(people, "John")
    Storage-->>Server: [Records]
    Server-->>Client: 200: [Ph Records]

    Note over Client,Server: Write Operation
    Client->>Server: ADD "name=Jane"
    Server->>Auth: Challenge(SSH-Key)
    Auth-->>Client: Challenge
    Client-->>Auth: Signed-Response
    Auth-->>Server: Verified
    Server->>Storage: Commit(Jane)
    Server-->>Client: 200: Success
```

## Core Components

### 1. Pharos Server (`pharos-server`)
The backend engine handling connection lifecycle, protocol parsing, and storage abstraction.
- **Protocol:** RFC 2378 (Ph) with `auth` extension.
- **Authentication:** SSH-key based challenge-response for Write operations.
- **Metrics:** Integrated Prometheus scrape point (`:9090/metrics`) and health monitoring.

### 2. CLI Clients
- **`ph`:** Optimized for human contact management.
- **`mdb`:** Optimized for machine/infrastructure asset management.
- **`pharos-scan`:** Automated discovery engine using mDNS and port probes to identify and provision assets into Pharos.
- All clients support automatic authentication via local SSH private keys and share a common async core.

### 3. Storage Tiering
- **Development:** Zero-configuration in-memory storage.
- **Home Lab:** File-level, restart-survivable JSON storage (optimized for LXC).
- **Enterprise:** LDAP-backed storage utilizing standard schemas (`inetOrgPerson`, `ipHost`).

## Multi-Tenant & Triple-Tier Security

Pharos implements a flexible security model designed to scale from a single user's "YOLO Lab" to a multi-tenant Enterprise environment.

### 1. Triple-Tier Security Model
Security is enforced at the server level based on the `PHAROS_SECURITY_MODE` configuration.

| Tier | Name | Read Access | Write Access | Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tier 1** | **Open (YOLO)** | Anonymous (Unauthenticated) | SSH-Key Authorized | Default Home Lab setup. High speed, low friction. |
| **Tier 2** | **Protected** | Token or IP-Based | SSH-Key Authorized | Shared Lab environments requiring basic privacy. |
| **Tier 3** | **Scoped** | Identity-Based (LDAP/OIDC) | Identity-Based (Team Scoped) | Multi-tenant Enterprise environments with strict isolation. |

### 2. Multi-Tenant Isolation
In **Scoped** mode, every record is associated with a `tenant_id` or `team_scope`.
- **Filtering**: Queries automatically inject a `(team_scope=...)` filter based on the requester's authenticated identity.
- **Provenance**: Every record contains metadata tracking the `created_by` identity and the `provisioned_at` timestamp.

## The Dual-Site Ecosystem

Pharos distinguishes between documentation (static) and management (dynamic) to ensure high availability and security.

```mermaid

        Marketing -.->|Self-Help| User

        Agent -.->|Tool Calls| Console
        User --- Console
    end
```

### 1. Marketing & Documentation (`iamrichardd.com/pharos/`)
- **Type**: Static Site (Astro/MDX).
- **Purpose**: Architecture guides, "How-To" tutorials, and open-source advocacy.
- **Why**: Ensures that even if your Pharos server is down, you still have access to the documentation on how to fix it.

### 2. Pharos Console (`pharos-console`)
- **Type**: Dynamic Web Application & MCP Server.
- **Purpose**: Real-time TUI/Web dashboard, SSH key management, and AI Agent orchestration.
- **Features**:
    - **WebMCP Bridge**: Allows your browser to act as a secure proxy for AI Agents.
    - **Pulse Monitor**: Real-time heartbeat visualization for all `pharos-pulse` agents.
    - **Enrollment**: One-click provisioning for new nodes.
