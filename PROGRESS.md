# Pharos State & Progress

## Current Status
**Phase:** 2 (Core Server MVP)
**Active Task:** Task 2.1 - Implement core TCP listener and base RFC 2378 (Ph) syntax parser.
**Active GitHub Issue:** #TBD
**Blockers:** None.

## Recent Completions
- [x] Project inception and system prompt (`GEMINI.md`) finalized.
- [x] Strict Zero-Host (Podman), Clean Architecture, and DORA metric tracking established.
- [x] Phase 1: Zero-Host & DevSecOps Foundation (Issue #1, #2, #3, #4, #5).

## AI Agent Instructions for Next Session
1. Read `GEMINI.md` to internalize strict Zero-Host constraints, Clean Code philosophies, and persona requirements.
2. Read `TODO.md` to understand the upcoming roadmap.
3. If the Active Task does not have a GitHub Issue (marked `#TBD`), use the `gh` CLI to create one, tag it appropriately (e.g., `phase-1`, `enhancement`), and update `TODO.md` and `PROGRESS.md` with the new Issue number.
4. Begin execution on the Active Task, utilizing Podman commands exclusively for execution.
5. Document the "Why" in any created files, ensuring the Standardized File Prologue is applied to all source files.
6. **Crucial:** Before concluding the session, push your commits, use `gh` to update or close the active GitHub issue (to maintain accurate DORA metrics), and update this `PROGRESS.md` file.
